ActiveType
==========

Quack like ActiveRecord
-----------------------

WIP


Installation
------------

In your `Gemfile` say:

    gem 'active_type'

Now run `bundle install` and restart your server.


Development
-----------

- Test applications for various Rails versions lives in `spec`.
- You need to create a MySQL database and put credentials into `spec/shared/app_root/config/database.yml`.
- You can bundle all test applications by saying `bundle exec rake all:bundle`
- You can run specs from the project root by saying `bundle exec rake all:spec`.

If you would like to contribute:

- Fork the repository.
- Push your changes **with passing specs**.
- Send me a pull request.

I'm very eager to keep this gem leightweight and on topic. If you're unsure whether a change would make it into the gem, [talk to me beforehand](mailto:henning.koch@makandra.de).
